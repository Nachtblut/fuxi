> 中国人从小就相信英雄得具有大无畏和自我牺牲精神（self-sacrif ice）。当国家利益和个人利益相冲突时，英雄们总是选择牺牲自己。刘胡兰和董存瑞在中国家喻户晓。在1947年，15岁的刘胡兰由于积极投身中国解放运动而被敌人杀害。战士董存瑞手托炸药包（a pack of explosives），炸毁了敌人的碉堡（blockhouse），并献出了自己的生命。
>
> > **Chinese people are brought up to believe that a hero has to be associated with tremendous courage and self-sacrifice. Whenever there is a contradiction between the interest of the nation and that of their own, Chinese heroes always choose to sacrifice themselves. Both Liu Hulan and Dong Cunrui are household names in China. Liu was a 15-year-old girl killed by the enemy in 1947 for being actively involved in liberation of China. And Dong was a soldier who blew off the enemy blockhouse by holding a pack of explosives in his hand and lost his life in the explosion.**

> 不同文化中的非语言交流（nonverbal communication）表现出极大的不同。中国文化重视间接和微妙（subtle）的方式，非语言交流在中国文化中特别重要。譬如，在中国，直接目光接触，尤其面对长者或上级，被认为是粗鲁之举。一些中国人可能将此解读为威胁或恐吓。年轻的中国人低下头，或是鞠躬，向长者表示敬意。握手一般是社会地位平等的人们之间的行为。另一个表示敬意的姿势是用双手呈上礼物或是名片
>
> > **Nonverbal communication in different cultures shows drastic differences. In Chinese culture, which values the indirect and subtle approach, nonverbal communication is especially important. For example, direct eye contact is considered rude in China, particularly with an elder or social superior. Some Chinese may interpret it as threatening or intimidating. Young Chinese people lower their heads and may bow slightly to show respect to an elder. Shaking hands is generally done only between people of equal social status. Another gesture of respect is presenting gifts and business cards with two hands.**
